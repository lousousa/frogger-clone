Inspired by the classic Frogger game, this web mobile-first adaptation is crafted using Vue 3 and TypeScript. Designing a game as a component-driven application posed a unique challenge, but it ultimately proved to be a robust approach for instantiating game objects with efficiency. Remarkably, this was achieved without relying on a dedicated game library, showcasing the versatility and power of Vue 3 and TypeScript in the realm of game development.
